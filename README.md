# nodeNoteList

A node list / to-do app build in tandem with a Udemy course. Learned about fileSync, yargs (a little) and passing json ih Node.
Use it if you have the command line open and you remember or want to make a list of things you need to get done in either your project or that day.

//node app.js --title name
//node app.js add --title="title" --body="body"
//node app.js read --title="title"
//node app.js delete --title="title"
//node app.js list
